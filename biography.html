  <h1>My Journey</h1>
  <article>
    <p>I was born with wide eyes and a restless mind in Ciudad Juárez, where dusty winds whispered stories, and life taught you early to be resilient. I grew up in a humble neighborhood, raised in part by my great-aunts, <strong>Carolina and Luz Peinado Jordan</strong> — two women of fierce wisdom. They would sit me down, their hands weathered but gentle, and remind me, <em>“Study, so you never have to depend on any man, and no one can take away your freedom.”</em></p>
    <p>Even in scarcity, I was rich with wonder. One day, when I was in <strong>elementary school</strong>, our humble school in Juárez received a donation from the United States: a science kit. Inside was a kaleidoscope — vibrant, swirling fragments of light — and a tiny caterpillar we were tasked with nurturing. That moment changed me. Science no longer felt distant; it felt alive, growing in my hands. That same year, my Aunt Carolina gifted me an encyclopedia sold in volumes. Each page felt like a wind...
    <p>But being bright wasn’t always easy. As a child, I was both <strong>autistic</strong> and <strong>gifted</strong>, though I didn’t have the words for either at the time. In elementary school, I often finished my work far ahead of the class. My teachers, not knowing what else to do with me, would send me outside to the schoolyard — alone — so I wouldn’t “distract the other children.” I remember sitting on the edge of the concrete, watching the world swirl while feeling like I didn’t belong to any...
    <p>I spoke too deeply, felt too much, and couldn’t understand why the world around me seemed to move so slowly while my mind raced ahead. Many saw it as misbehavior or arrogance. But every so often, someone with deep emotional intelligence — a teacher, a classmate, a neighbor — would see through the chaos and offer kindness, guidance, or patience. Their compassion stayed with me. Their gestures reminded me that connection was possible, even when I felt like a stranger in my own world.</p>
    <p>Life at home was harder than most knew. My father, the man who should have protected me, became a source of pain. There were things I endured that left invisible bruises. But I learned to protect my spirit with curiosity, with learning, and with love. I found refuge in knowledge. I found myself.</p>
    <p>Years later, I crossed into the United States as a single mother with nothing but two daughters and a dream. We rented a small apartment. I slept on an inflatable mattress for six months while my girls had real beds.</p>
    <p>But the hardest part wasn’t material — it was emotional. I never wanted my daughters to grow up in a daycare, raised by strangers. I wanted to give them the best thing a mother can offer: her attention, her love, her presence. I wanted to be the one who taught them what life is, what it means to be kind, responsible, and strong. I wanted to shape their world with my own hands.</p>
    <p>So, I found a way. I woke up at 4:00 AM, cooked burritos, and sold them on campus while studying for my associate’s degrees in Chemistry and Biology. I worked part-time, went to class, and timed everything to be there when they got out of school. I slept only four hours a night and carried notebooks in one hand and lunch boxes in the other.</p>
    <p>We didn’t have much — my shoes were torn, my wardrobe thin — but our hearts were full. I was a present mother. I helped with homework, cooked warm meals, and raised my daughters with everything I had. They are strong, intelligent, and beautiful human beings — and they are my greatest reason for becoming more.</p>
    <p>Then came the turning point — the space project that changed my life. Our experiment was selected to fly aboard the International Space Station. That’s where I met <strong>Dr. Gertrud Konings</strong>, who looked me in the eye and said, <em>“Why do you doubt yourself? You built something that went to space. You belong here.”</em> Her belief in me shattered the last wall of fear. That day, I gave myself permission to dream — not just of space, but of becoming an astronaut.</p>
    <p>Since then, my journey has been anything but conventional. I’ve mentored international teams of students from Peru and Belize. I’ve worked on NASA-affiliated projects. I’ve prototyped systems for sustainability and built automation tools in Python. I’ve 3D-printed components, designed mounting systems, and learned to fabricate solutions from scratch — because for me, engineering is not just technical. It’s about creating tools that solve real problems.</p>
    <p>I often return in memory to the ashes of wildfires in the Sierra Tarahumara — the same fires that inspired one of my latest engineering projects: a wind-powered water remediation system. I think of the people we want to help. I think of my daughters, now growing into women of purpose and compassion. I think of my great-aunts, their voices echoing still: <em>“Study, so no one can ever control your life.”</em></p>
    <p>There’s also a part of my journey shaped by love — complex, imperfect, but deeply human. When I met <strong>Omar</strong> during my studies at EPCC, our relationship went through many seasons. We faced emotional challenges, moments of distance, and painful lessons on both sides. At times, the relationship tested me — but it also became a space of learning, healing, and eventually, growth.</p>
    <p>What made the difference was his decision to change — not with promises, but with action. He chose to seek help, take responsibility, and rebuild what had been broken. Over time, he became a steady and supportive presence in my life, not just for me, but for my daughters as well.</p>
    <p>When I was sick, he was there. When I fractured my knee, he cared for me. Even when we were no longer together, he quietly supported me — once leaving rent money when I needed it most, or showing up with a heavy bag of school supplies for my girls when no one else did. He never asked for praise. He simply cared, in the most grounded and generous ways.</p>
    <p>Twelve years later, we are still walking this path — older, wiser, and more united than before. I love him not because the road was easy, but because he chose to grow alongside me. And I chose to stay, not out of convenience, but because I witnessed transformation born out of love and respect.</p>
    <p>And through it all, there was my sister, <strong>Itchel</strong> — just eleven months older, yet always years wiser in the ways that mattered. She’s been my quiet compass, the one who never gave up on me, even when I doubted myself. As someone who lives with autism, I often struggled to connect or fit in. But Itchel never treated me like I was “different.” She guided me with love and patience — helping me communicate better, dress with confidence, even fix my hair. She taught me how to be myself ...
    <p>Our bond has always been strong, but what I treasure most is how she lifts me. When I fall, she reminds me who I am. When I rise, she cheers the loudest. She is brilliant, compassionate, steady, and kind — and part of everything I’ve achieved.</p>
    <p>In the next five years, I plan to graduate, earn my place in the aerospace field, and use my work to uplift communities — especially women and young students who feel like their dreams are too far to touch. I want to help my family thrive, build a legacy of resilience, and maybe, one day, reach the stars — not just for myself, but for every person who was told they couldn’t.</p>
    <p><strong>Because I am not here in spite of my past. I am here because of it.</strong></p>
